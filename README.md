# DigiantsPHP v1
## What is it?
I thought I'd share the "framework" I've been basing my simpler PHP projects on. 
It is not really a framework that offers every other solution, but still gets small projects done.

## Get Started
After you've cloned this repo (or downloded and extracted it), open your OS terminal, and cd to the root of the cloned repo, then
```bash
composer install
```
